      <section class="about">
        <h3 class="section-heading">About Me</h3>
        <p class="about-content">Kirsty is a hawt, independent capricorn.</p>
        <p class="about-content">After graduating from a Trinity, Kirsty was on a one-woman mission to tell everyone how good Trinity was. Kirsty has experience fencing for Scott McKay. She specialises in winding up wire.</p>
        <p class="about-content">She has freelanced with a number of production companies. All of them poorly run and staffed by idiots.</p>
        <p class="about-content">Amidst the commercial work she focuses on hating her cat Taco, watching MAFS and eating Spensleys pizza. She has a thirst for a bottle or two of Pet Nat most nights.</p>
        <p class="about-content">Kirsty likes to wake up on the couch with no memory of the night gone, before jumping on her work computer to wave the mouse around, send a few unintelligable emails before calling it a 10.37am and putiting on re-runs of MAFs.</p>
